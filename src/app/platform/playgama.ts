/**
 * Playgama Bridge (https://github.com/Playgama/bridge) wrapper. index.html of the Playgama build loads Bridge from
 * Playgama's CDN (https://bridge.playgama.com/v2/stable/playgama-bridge.js) as its first script and initializes it
 * before the game bundle runs (vite.config.ts, scripts/playgama/boot.js); outside Playgama, Bridge runs its mock
 * platform (no ads, local storage).
 * - init (before the menu): `bridge.initialize()` (called by the boot script, see initBridge), then `platform.language` (Bridge's own fallback is the
 *   browser language; the game falls back to English), the save through Bridge Storage (one `storage.get([...])` of
 *   every key), `platform.isAudioEnabled`, and the AUDIO_STATE_CHANGED / PAUSE_STATE_CHANGED events
 * - `game_ready` once the loading screen is gone and the player can play (`gameReady()`, called by main.ts)
 * - gameplay start → `level_started`; a won level → `level_completed`, a lost one → `level_failed` (Bridge has no
 *   gameplay start / stop); `game_ready` is always the first: a gameplay message before it is held and sent right
 *   after it (send)
 * - interstitials (`advertisement.showInterstitial()`) at every result-screen break between levels, after a click,
 *   with no counter or timer of the game's own: how often one shows is Bridge's call
 *   (Bridge's own platform default delay between interstitials (no override in playgama-bridge-config.json), Playgama's interstitial docs); never during a
 *   level, never before the first level has ended, no pre-roll
 * - rewarded (`advertisement.showRewarded()`) only from the labelled ad buttons (`available` is Bridge's
 *   `isRewardedSupported`, so the buttons are hidden where Bridge has no rewarded ads); the reward is granted only
 *   when Bridge reports the `rewarded` state; closed / failed without it: no reward
 * - every ad request settles exactly once (closed / failed, not opened within AD_TIMEOUT, or AD_MAX in all)
 * - an ad opening, Bridge's pause state and the page being hidden pause the level and mute all audio; Bridge's audio
 *   state mutes without pausing; audio comes back only when nothing keeps the game silent, and then through the
 *   player's own sound / music settings (audio.ts)
 * - Bridge 2.4.1's PAUSE_STATE_CHANGED is an aggregate of its interstitial, rewarded, visibility, platform and rate
 *   states, and its rewarded part stays `true` while the last rewarded state is `opened` or `rewarded`. The Playgama
 *   platform bridge passes the SDK's events through as they come and turns an `error` after `open` into a popup only,
 *   so a `rewarded` after `close`, or an error after `open`, leaves Bridge's pause on with no `false` ever sent. So a
 *   Bridge pause that starts while an ad is open (or within AD_PAUSE_GRACE after it settled) belongs to the ad: it is
 *   cleared when the ad settles and ignored right after it. Only a really hidden page keeps the game paused then.
 * - a `rewarded` state that comes after `closed` (within REWARD_GRACE) still grants the reward
 */
